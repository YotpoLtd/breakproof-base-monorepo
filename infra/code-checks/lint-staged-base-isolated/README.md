# `@repo/lint-staged-base-isolated`

This package does 3 things:

1. provide detailed base configuration for `lint-staged`
   1. **standard usage**: simply extend it in the lint-staged config of your
      package
   2. **extras**:
      1. the base file also exports some useful variables:
         1. `ESLINT_PATTERN` ‚Äì if you want to override the `eslint` command
            without duplicating the pattern
         2. `PRETTIER_PATTERN` ‚Äì if you want to override the `prettier` command
            without duplicating the pattern
         3. `TSC_PATTERNS_PER_TSCONFIG` ‚Äì if you want to override the `tsc`
            command without duplicating the patterns
         4. `TSC_CONFIG_FILENAMES` ‚Äì if you want to add other commands for
            `TypeScript` files
         5. `TSC_COMMANDS_PER_TSCONFIG` ‚Äì the actual `tsc` command that will be
            executed for each `tsconfig`
      2. you can use 2 environment variables to quickly switch behaviour of the
         code checks instead of reconfiguring them:
         1. `LINT_SHOULD_FIX` ‚Äì when non-empty, use same configuration but
            instead of just reporting problems, try fixing them. Only the
            commands that can autofix are run.
         2. `ESLINT_ACTIVE_CONFIG` ‚Äì when non-empty, switch eslint config file
            without overriding the entire command. The value can be a relative
            path to your package or absolute one.
2. lets other packages run `lint-staged` checks using **_this_** package's
   specific `node.js` version. It works by providing a scripts called
   `staged:lint` and `staged:fix:lint` in its `package.json` that other packages
   can call instead of calling `lint-staged`:
3. re-export `lint-staged` types so that you can refer to them in your project
   configs

You can find [info about `lint-staged`](../../../docs/tools-details.md) about
the role, config & alternatives of each tool.

## Caveats

1. Since all packages by default depend on `@repo/lint-staged-base-isolated`, it
   cannot install other packages without a cyclic/circular dependency. Instead,
   during CI/CD we rely on `@repo/citools` to install the needed dependencies
   and during local development we rely on `@repo/devtools` to do that. Circular
   dependencies inside the repository are forbidden, because this practices
   allows bad code composition.
2. Due to the limitation above üëÜÔ∏è, we also use
   `@repo/circular-dependency-workaround` to actually import
   `<repo root>/infra/code-checks` packages and run checks here. Those
   code-checks are again installed via `@repo/citools`/`@repo/devtools`.
3. Because of the same limitation üëÜÔ∏è, on CI/CD we can't detect if a package is
   affected by a change of a specific package in
   `<repo root>/infra/code-checks`. So if anything in
   `<repo root>/infra/code-checks` is changed -> CI/CD will run checks for all
   packages that directly or indirectly depend on `infra/code-checks/**`
