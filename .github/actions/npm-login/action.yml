description: Configure needed files to be authenticated in a npm registry

#
# Unlike reusable workflows, reusable actions like this one can't inherit secrets
#
# For that reason, the authentication secrets for npm registry are exposed as environment variables:
#
#  - `SECRET_NPM_REGISTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` ‚Äì for this to have a value you must create a secret in your
#     repository settings called `NPM_REGISTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`
#  - `SECRET_NPM_REGISTRY_USER` ‚Äì for this to have a value you must create a secret in your
#     repository settings called `NPM_REGISTRY_USER`
#  - `SECRET_NPM_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` ‚Äì for this to have a value you must create a secret in your
#     repository settings called `NPM_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`
#
